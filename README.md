Yarer (Yet another Rpn expression resolver) is a flexible library, written in Rust, for the processing, compilation and evaluation of Reverse Polish mathematical expressions.

Example of usage of the library: 
      
```rust
      let exp = "((10 + 5) â€“ 3 * (9 / 3)) + 2";
      let resolver = RpnResolver::parse(exp);
      println!("The result of {} is {}", exp, resolver.resolve());
```

All that's needed is to create a new instance of the RpnResolver and hand over the expression to be analysed.
The library just returns a variant natural number, or a decimal number if one exists in the expression (i.e '2.+1').

Yarer can handle also variables. Here an example:

```rust
      let resolver = RpnResolver::parse("3/(5*x^2)");
      resolver.set("x",4);
      println!("The result of {} is {}", exp, resolver.resolve());
```

Yarer can be used also from command line, and behaves in a very similar manner to bc

```rust
      Yarer
      > 4+2.2
      6.2
      > (1./2)
      0.5
      > x=10
      > 3/(5*x^2)
```
